#School Projects - Master's in Data Analytics

This repository showcases a collection of projects completed during my Master's program in Data Analytics.
##Project Listing

*Project 1: Predicting 5-Star Customer Reviews Yelp Dataset

This code explores predicting 5-star ratings in Yelp reviews using text analysis. It achieves an accuracy of ~84% and identifies key terms associated with positive reviews. This demonstrates the potential to use text data for both rating prediction and business insights.

*Project 2: Time Series Modeling

This project explores using time series models to identify seasonal patterns in revenue data (A1). The goal is to leverage these seasonal trends for forecasting purposes (A2). By analyzing the first two years of revenue data, the project aims to predict future churn rates. Identifying seasonal trends can help distinguish between regular fluctuations and potential churn, leading to more accurate forecasting and better customer retention strategies.

*Project 3: Market Basket Analysis

This project investigates frequently purchased items in a dataset. It aims to identify the most popular product (A1) and use lift analysis to discover items often bought together beyond random chance (A2). This information can be used to recommend products likely to interest customers, potentially reducing churn rates. The project seeks to provide insights for marketing campaigns.
