## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**I'm Steven Oldenburg**, a data professional. I'm passionate about leveraging data and Python to solve problems and extract insights.

### My Projects

#### Data Science & Machine Learning

* **Time Series Modeling:** This is a college project that uses time series modeling to forecast predictions and detect seasonal trends.  A weekly trend was identified and the predict was relatively accurate, however, it should be noted that the model is only accurate are predicting trends in revenue, not daily revenue income.

* **Market Basket Analysis:** This was a college project for my masters degree to use A/B testing to draw insights of customer behavoirs.  We found that customers who purchased monitor mounts also purchased Co2 dust off and these two projects pair well together for future marketing initiatives.

* **NLP and Logistic Regression:** Finaly project, I built a model to predict star ratings based on Yelp reviews using NLP techniques. Further explored topic analysis and word frequency insights.  Findings were that 17% of the 5-star reviews in the yelp dataset were not organic customers and often were "trying" new things.  The findings also suggest that certain items draw people to give 5-star ratings more often such as coffee, sandwhiches or chicken.

* **Web Scraping Project:** Personal project to grow, I created this project to learn how to use Python to scrape a webpage efficently.  This is a very old project.
