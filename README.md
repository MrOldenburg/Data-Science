## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**I'm Steven Oldenburg**, a data professional. I'm passionate about leveraging data and Python to solve problems and extract insights.  Most of these projects are from college, however, I'm currently employed as a data analyst at a healthcare organization, I've been learning a lot, especially since I am the only analytical professional in the organization.

### My Projects

#### Current Projects ():
* **Fully Automate Reporting:** This is an ongoing project at work, I dont have access to any modern software such as Data Bricks or Docker. I thought, it would be nice to have a Python library that is deployable, and customizable that interacts with SQL using template inforamtion.  I've created code to do all of this and even email it to the recipent.  It would be nice however, if I can use the same library for ETL pipelines.
* **ETL Pipelines:** I'm currently expanding the ETL pipelines as well as fixing SQL coding errors.  The current pipeline was setup by another which its beatiful code, with very little functionality.  Imagine it has multiple layers using objects in a python library that he wrote himself.  Well the SQL data is loaded into a back layer and never brought to front, so I can't manipulate the file in the ETL process.  I would need to manipluate the created libraries which to be honest is just more work, instead I figure I can rewrite the whole code in a standard deployable way to knock out two birds with one stone.
* **Claims Prediction:** I've started to map out data needed to create a claims prediction model.  The idea is to setup a framework that will predict rejected claims, and if not rejected, the dollar ammount paid. I'm sure most healthcare organizations have some type of process to do this, this goes beyond just catching paperwork errors.  Most of this information is categorical information, so the next step in the process is to use exploratory data analysis on who is rejecting claims, the procedures and billing codes.  With all of the possible billing codes, procedures and how each insurer handles them differently it might need to be scaled down to provide value to any business, especially since I am just working with limited resources.
* **Data Analysis:** I've started to provide full executive reports to the C-suite and E-team with recommendations to solve business problems.  These have been the funnest out of all the projects to work on, as it provides the data to change the direction of the organization.  This involves pulling data from a lot of unconvential places, merging it all together and analyzing it in PowerBI.  From there I write a report that is 3-7 pages long (with visuals :)) telling the story of how things have changed overtime and pointing out key historical impacts.
* **PowerBI KPI Dashboard:**  I've been learning through projects and from DataCamp how to effectively use PowerBI.  Some dashboards have already been deployed but this part of my job seems more like a work of art and requires exceptional networking and communication skills to create effective dashboards.  It's a good thing I'm comfertable talking to people with a background in teaching and negoiations.

#### Data Science & Machine Learning (Old College Projects)

* **Time Series Modeling:** [This](https://github.com/MrOldenburg/Data-Science/blob/main/Time_Series_Modeling.pdf) is a college project that uses time series modeling to forecast predictions and detect seasonal trends.  A weekly trend was identified and the predict was relatively accurate, however, it should be noted that the model is only accurate are predicting trends in revenue, not daily revenue income.

* **Market Basket Analysis:** [This](https://github.com/MrOldenburg/Data-Science/blob/main/Market_Basket.pdf) was a college project for my masters degree to use A/B testing to draw insights of customer behavoirs.  We found that customers who purchased monitor mounts also purchased Co2 dust off and these two projects pair well together for future marketing initiatives.

* **NLP and Logistic Regression:** Final project, I built a model to predict star ratings based on Yelp reviews using NLP techniques. Further explored topic analysis and word frequency insights.  Findings were that 17% of the 5-star reviews in the yelp dataset were not organic customers and often were "trying" new things.  The findings also suggest that certain items draw people to give 5-star ratings more often such as coffee, sandwhiches or chicken.  The written explination with code can be found [here](https://github.com/MrOldenburg/Data-Science/blob/main/Market_Basket.pdf) presentation I created in Tableau can be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/steven.oldenburg5836/viz/YelpDatasetPresentation/Study), it contains talking points but not the full video explination I gave to a non-technical audience.

* **Web Scraping Project:** Personal project to grow, I created [This](https://github.com/MrOldenburg/Data-Science/blob/main/Toscrape-Books-Example.ipynb) project to learn how to use Python to scrape a webpage efficently.  This is a very old project, but showcases my willingness and dedication to learn as well as how farm I've come from a simple webscrapper.  This code pulls thousands of book records from torscrape and writes it to a nice and neat .CSV file.
